* THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
It is not functional other than simply a very simple example of microservices under docker and nginx.  Feel free to contribute!

To use:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:trollboy/docker-nginx-express.git
cd docker-nginx-express
docker-compose up --build
```
> PROTIP: After initial installation, you need only run `docker-compose up`.  This will still load your local changes, but will be *much* quicker.
